# Open Turntable
This is the codebase for our UMass CS335 final project: an open source digital turntable. It is intended to be used with [Mixxx](https://mixxx.org/), which handles audio playback. MIDI commands are sent over the LPC1768's secondary USB data line. Mixxx processes them and turns them into play/pause, cue, jog wheel adjust, volume adjust, and tempo adjust commands.


## How to Build
1. Install the [GCC ARM Embedded Toolchain](https://developer.arm.com/tools-and-software/open-source-software/developer-tools/gnu-toolchain/gnu-rm/downloads) and enter its path in env.py.
2. Install the [MBED CLI](https://os.mbed.com/docs/mbed-os/v5.15/tools/manual-installation.html).
3. Run `make`.

## How to run
1. Plug in LPC1768.
2. Run `make deploy`. Make sure the microcontroller's mount point is specified in Makefile.
